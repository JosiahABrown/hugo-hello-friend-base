I am an experienced software developer skilled in designing, installing, testing, and maintaining software systems. Passionate about scripting, I create efficient solutions tailored to the unique needs of organizations. I have experience in unit testing, automation, Docker, Git and Amazon Web Services. Committed to furthering the mission of any company I work for, and willing to share my knowledge and experience with my colleagues. I am always looking for new opportunities to put my skills to work.



# Experience
### Solutions Engineer @ BeyondMD

- **Creating a Python Selenium Unit-Testing bot** for the company product. It would crawl the website and provide feedback based on the results.

# Projects
Here are just a few of my projects. You can find the rest of them on [my GitHub](https://github.com/JosiahABrown).
### [Numistastic](https://github.com/JosiahABrown/Numistastic)
*A coin collection management system* built using **Python** and **SQLite**. The current state of the project is using the **json** library to parse files containing data about each US coin minted since the Revolutionary war. 

The future goal for the project is to create a cross-platform application that can store data on coins offline and provide the user with information about the coin along with prices. 

### [Liberum](https://github.com/JosiahABrown/nft-marketplace)
*A NFT Marketplace* that uses the Polygon network. It was built with tools such as **ReactJS**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Solidity**. The post explaining the project can be found [here](https://medium.com/@josiah.alen.brown/how-i-built-an-nft-marketplace-in-one-month-dd9dbce08be0).

### [News-CLI](https://github.com/JosiahABrown/News-CLI)
*A command line tool that displays the news*. It utilized **Selenium** to scrape [The Epoch Times](https://www.theepochtimes.com/). To help run the program, a **Docker** file is included that runs the required chrome webdriver. 

# Education
### [Praxis](https://discoverpraxis.com/)
*Aug 2021 - Aug 2022*

Praxis is an intensive 12-month alternative education program for entrepreneurial young people who want real-world career experience and a rigorous, self-directed educational experience all in one.

My time at Praxis was spent improving my business-oriented mindset and personal brand name, along with working on professional projects such as content creation and a month-long final project.

### [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
*A while now*

freeCodeCamp is a charitable organization that provides high-quality coding tutorials for free. They have thousands of videos and courses for almost every aspect of computer science and professional development. 

There is no true start or end date since everything is free and available at all times. I started my journey in development through some of their simple tutorials on YouTube. 

In September 2022 I began their **Scientific Computer with Python** course. Through it, I learned more about the Python language in a deeper way and gained a certificate to verify my work.
